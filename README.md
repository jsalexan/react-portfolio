  ## Description
  This is a React portfolio application that features my web development projects to date. I will continually update. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: React, Bootstrap, NodeJS, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, JSON, GitHub Pages, and Git.
  <br><br>
  I largely based the design for the site off the original portfolio I created early in my bootcamp. But working with React really made the site come to life. I struggled a bit with some of the new processes, but all in all it was pretty straightforward. I can see why so many people love React.
  <br><br>
  There is so much I'd like to do in the future. I'd like to add some animations and possibly rework the portfolio section.
